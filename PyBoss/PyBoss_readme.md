### Instructions
In this challenge, you get to be the _boss_. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.

Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:

* Import the `employee_data.csv` file, which currently holds employee records like the below:

```csv
Emp ID,Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah Simpson,1985-12-04,282-01-8166,Florida
15,Samantha Lara,1993-09-08,848-80-7526,Colorado
411,Stacy Charles,1957-12-20,658-75-8526,Pennsylvania
```

* Then convert and export the data to use the following format instead:

```csv
Emp ID,First Name,Last Name,DOB,SSN,State
214,Sarah,Simpson,12/04/1985,***-**-8166,FL
15,Samantha,Lara,09/08/1993,***-**-7526,CO
411,Stacy,Charles,12/20/1957,***-**-8526,PA
```

* In summary, the required conversions are as follows:

  * The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.

  * The `DOB` data should be re-written into `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

  * The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.

  * The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.

### Resources
employee_data.csv is in the Resources directory and is the data that was utilized in the execution of main.py in the PyBoss directory.

### Process
The program main.py sets up access to the emplyee_data.csv file and loops through the file, generating the modifications required. 
* The variable us_state_abbrev was setup as a dictionary with the state name as the key that is associated to the 2 character abbreviation for each state.
* The variable emp_id stores the employee id for each row of our loop.
* The variable name stores the employee name for each row of our loop.   The variables first_name and last_name are generated by splitting name using the space as the split.
* The variable dob stores the employee date of birth for each row of our loop.   The variable output_dob is the dob with a format of month/day/year instead of the original year/month/day
* The variable ssn stores the employee social security number and the variable output_ssn has the first two parts of the social security number changed to asterics.
* The variable state stores the state name for each row of our loop.   The variable state_abbrev stores the state abbreviation for the state name using us_state_abbrev dictionary.
* The variable output_data is a list with the modified output of the data for each row.
* The final task performed is to output the data in the variable output to the screen and write it to the file /Analysis/PyBoss_Export.csv.

### Functions
* file_read: This fuction opens the Resource csv file, reads the data and loops through the data creating the modified data required.
* file_write: This function opens the file PyBoss_Export.csv in the Analysis directory under the PyBoss directory.  It then writes out the collected data output_data that was created when file_read was executed.
* main: This fuction executes the file_read and then file_write and finally outputs a message that states that we have created the export file.
